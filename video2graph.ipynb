    "# Creating a Knowledge Graph from Video Transcripts with GPT-4\n",
    "## Use GPT-4 as a domain expert to help you extract knowledge from a video transcript\n",
    "\n",
    "A couple of days ago, I got access to GPT-4. The first thing that came to my mind was to test how well it performs as an information extraction model, where the task is to extract relevant entities and relationships from a given text. I have already played around with GPT-3.5 a bit. The most important thing I noticed is that we don't want to use the GPT endpoint as an entity linking solution or have it come up with any other external references like citations, as it likes to hallucinate those types of information.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, a great thing about GPT-3 or GPT-4 is that it performs well in various domains. For example, we can use it to extract people, organizations, or locations from a text. However, I feel that competing against dedicated NLP models is not where the GPT models shine (although they perform well). Instead, the strength of GPT models is in their ability to generalize and be used in other domains where other open-sourced models fail due to their limited training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "My friend Michael Hunger gave me a great idea to test the GPT-4 on extracting information from a nature documentary. I always liked the deep sea documentary as the ecosystem and animals are so vastly different from terrestrial ones. Therefore, I decided to test GPT-4 information extraction capabilities on an underwater documentary. Additionally, I don't know of any open-source NLP models trained to detect relationships between sea plants and creatures. So, a deep sea documentary makes for an excellent example of using a GPT-4 to construct a knowledge graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "The most accessible place to find documentaries is YouTube. Although the GPT-4 is multi-modal (supports video, audio, and text), the current version of the endpoint only supports text inputs. Therefore, we will analyze a video's audio transcript, not the video itself.\n",
    "We will be analyzing the transcript of the following documentary.\n",
    "\n",
    "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrI483C5Tro\n",
    "\n",
    "First of all, I like the topic of the documentary. Secondly, extracting captions from a YouTube video is effortless as we don't have to use any audio2text models at all. However, converting audio to text with all the available models on HuggingFace or even OpenAI's Whisper shouldn't be a big problem. Thirdly, this video has captions that are not auto-generated. At first, I tried to extract information from auto-generated captions on YouTube, but I learned that they might not be the best input. So if you can, avoid using auto-generated YouTube captions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The captions can be retrieved straightforwardly with the YouTube Transcript/Subtitle library. All we have to do is to provide the video id."

In all honesty, I'm not entirely sure which endpoint I would use to recreate this blog post without GPT-4. As far as I know, there are no open-source relation extraction models or datasets on sea creatures. Therefore, to avoid the hassle of labeling a dataset and training a custom model, we can simply utilize a GPT endpoint. Furthermore, I'm eagerly anticipating the opportunity to examine its promised capability for multi-modal analysis based on audio or text input."
